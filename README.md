   - or locally (via file synchronization and the music player of your choice).
5. REST API for those who want to develop their own client.
6. Easy to
    1. Install (one executable file to copy, and you are done)
    2. Backup (all data in one folder)
    3. Secure (https by default)
7. Blazing fast navigation with console & web clients.
8. Multiplatform.
9. You can even build your [own internet radio](https://github.com/jypelle/vekigi) to listen to your playlists !

### Opinionated

This software doesnâ€™t try to satisfy the needs of everyone.

- The number of features is voluntarily limited to facilitate its maintenance.
- Only **flac** and **mp3** formats are supported.
- When you import some music on mifasol server, **song filenames are ignored**, only song tags are used to link your song to an artist, an album or to know the song name.
- Once your music is imported, **song tags are partially managed by mifasol server** and are used to generate song filename during files sync.
- **Only one-way sync is supported**: song files and playlists are copied from mifasol server to client device.

## Mifasol server

### Installation

#### From prebuild binaries

Drop the dedicated `mifasolsrv` binary on your server and you are done.

#### From sources

You need:

- Linux
- Golang >= 1.25.2
- ANDROID_NDK_HOME set (to build android console client).
- GOROOT set

```
make release
```

### Usage

#### Run

```
mifasolsrv run
```

Use Ctrl+C to gracefully stop it (and to avoid database corruption).

On first launch, `mifasolsrv run` will:
- Create default admin user with `mifasol`/`mifasol` as username/password
- Create a self-signed certificate valid for localhost only
- Listen requests on https://localhost:6620

#### Configuration

If you want to access your server with those external urls: https://mypersonaldomain.org:6630 and https://77.77.77.77:6630, you should configure mifasolsrv accordingly with:

```
mifasolsrv config -hostnames mypersonaldomain.org,77.77.77.77 -n 6630 -enable-ssl
```

#### More options

Run 

```
mifasolsrv --help
mifasolsrv <COMMAND> --help
```

for more information.

### Where is my data stored ?

Configuration file, embedded database, song and cover files are all saved into **mifasolsrv** config folder: 

- `$HOME/.config/mifasolsrv` on linux
- `%LocalAppData%\mifasolsrv` on windows
- `$HOME/Library/Application Support/mifasolsrv` on mac

#### Backup data

- Stop mifasol server
- Backup **mifasolsrv** config folder content
- Start mifasol server

#### Restore data

- Stop mifasol server
- Replace **mifasolsrv** config folder with content from your last backup
- Start mifasol server

### Auto start and stop mifasol server with systemd on linux

- Copy `mifasolsrv` to `/usr/bin`
- Create systemd service file

    ```
    sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/mifasolsrv.service
    sudo chmod 664 /etc/systemd/system/mifasolsrv.service
    ```

- Edit /etc/systemd/system/mifasolsrv.service

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Mifasol server
    
    [Service]
    Type=simple
    Restart=on-failure
    ExecStart=/usr/bin/mifasolsrv run
    User=myuser
    Group=myuser
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=multi-user.target
    ```

- Enable & start mifasol server

    ```
    sudo systemctl daemon-reload
    sudo systemctl enable mifasolsrv.service
    sudo systemctl start mifasolsrv.service
    ```

## Mifasol web client

You just have to connect to your mifasol server: https://localhost:6620

## Mifasol console client

### Installation

#### From prebuild binaries

Mifasol server embeds clients, so you just have to download the dedicated `mifasolcli` binary from your mifasol server: https://localhost:6620

#### From sources

You need golang >= 1.25.2 and
- `libasound2-dev` on linux
- `mingw-w64` on windows
- `AudioToolbox.framework` on mac

```
go install ./cmd/mifasolcli
```

### Usage

#### Configuration

On first launch, *mifasolcli* try to connect to mifasol server using https://localhost:6620
(only accepting server self-signed certificate read on first connection) with `mifasol`/`mifasol` as username/password.

You can change default configuration with:

```
mifasolcli config -hostname <HOSTNAME> -n 6620 -u mifasol -p mifasol
```

NB: \<HOSTNAME\> should match with one of the hostnames configured on mifasol server.

#### Import music folder content to mifasol server

```
mifasolcli import [Location of music folder to import]
```

*mifasolcli* will recursively loop through specified folder to import every `flac` and `mp3` files to mifasol server.

#### Sync local music folder with mifasol server's user favorite content

Prepare local music folder (one-time):
```
mifasolcli filesync init [Location of folder to synchronize]
```

Launch synchronization:
```
mifasolcli filesync sync [Location of folder to synchronize]
```

#### Console user interface

Run console user interface to manage and listen mifasol server content:

```
mifasolcli ui
```

Press `h` to display available shortcuts to navigate through the interface.

##### Tips:

- **After a fresh server installation, use the console or web client to change the default username/password**.
- Windows users should use new *Windows Terminal* to correctly display unicode emojis.  

#### More options

Run 

```
mifasolcli --help
mifasolcli <COMMAND> --help
mifasolcli <COMMAND> <SUBCOMMAND> --help
```

for more information.
